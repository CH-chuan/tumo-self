## Tech Stack

Tumo is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (can be configured to use PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Storage**: Local filesystem or Amazon S3
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI, Replicate (easily extensible to others)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/datamonet/tumo
   cd tumo
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Create an `.env` file to store API keys. Use `.env.example` as a reference.

3. Tumo uses SQLite as its database by default, which requires no additional setup. If you prefer PostgreSQL, you can configure it by uncommenting and updating the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file.

4. Tumo supports two storage options for generated media files: local filesystem and Amazon S3.

   You can store generated media files in the local filesystem:

   ```
   MEDIA_STORAGE_TYPE=local
   MEDIA_STORAGE_PATH=./generated-media
   ```

   Or, you can use Amazon S3 to store generated media files:

   ```
   MEDIA_STORAGE_TYPE=s3
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

5. Initialize the database and create an admin user:

   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/reset-db.ts
   ```

   This script will set up the database schema and create an admin user (default: admin@takin.ai with password 'demo').

6. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application and use admin user to login.
